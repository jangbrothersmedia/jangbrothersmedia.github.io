  <h1>Aigoo of the Week: Why you should NOT be a Kiwoom Heroes Fan</h1>
  <p class="lead">Author: Andrew Jang</p>

  <h3>A rant written by a Kiwoom Heroes Fan</h3>
  
  <p>Before I first started really following the KBO in 2016, my favorite team was the Samsung Lions. As a bandwagon fan, it was hard to resist the lure of a team who had recently won 4 championships in a row with legendary players such as Lee Seung-Yuop and Oh Seung-Hwan. But in 2016, I went to my first ever KBO game, the 2016 All-Star Game at the Nexen Heroes' newly built stadium, Gocheok Sky Dome. My family and I were lucky enough to get tickets right in front of the cheering section and I immediately fell in love with the atmosphere of Korean Baseball. My favorite player was Kim Ha-Seong, as I had seen him in the All-Star game, so by association, I started rooting for the Nexen Heroes. I was still learning about the KBO and its history and wanted to immerse myself in the knowledge of my new favorite team's past. I learned that they were the ones to lose in the 2014 Korean Series to the Samsung Lions. I learned about their former star players, Park Byung-Ho and Kang Jung-Ho, as well as their current top performers, Seo Geon-Chang, Kim Ha-Seong, Kim Min-Sung, Andy Van Hekken, Park Dong-Won, Lee Taek-Geun, and Go Jong-Wook. In the 2017 season, the first season I really started to follow the KBO routinely, the team had already lost Park Byung-Ho and Kang Jung-Ho as they went to the majors. But they bolstered their team in a big way by adding outfielder Lee Jung-Hoo. As a fan I was ecstatic. I felt like our team was a mix of good pitching with a top-tier lineup including many young players as well as solid veterans. However, the first crack began to show on July 7th, 2017. Kiwoom traded their current DH, Yoon Suk-Min, to KT for reliever Jung Dae-Hyeon, reliever Seo Eui-Tae, and 500,000,000 Won. As a young fan who had grown attached to these players, I was extremely sad to the point of crying when the news of this trade broke as Yoon Suk-Min was also one of my favorite players on the team. But analyzing the trade afterward is slightly questionable as well. Now Yoon Suk-Min was going to become a free agent at the end of the season, but the return was horrid. In his three seasons with the team, Yoon Suk-Min had two .800 OPS seasons and every season he finished with at least 10 home runs. In return, the two pitchers Nexen acquired were not productive. Seo Eui-Tae went on to pitch 0.2 IP in his entire career for Kiwoom, and Jung Dae-Hyeon would pitch for them in 2017 finishing with a 7.06 ERA. Of course, a DH can be found anywhere but I was still frustrated with the deal. More recently in 2022, Kiwoom decided to trade their catcher Park Dong-Won. In the first half, Park was having a great year and was arguably the best catcher in the KBO. Kiwoom again decided to trade one of their star players who they could have used. Now if Park Dong-Won had decided to leave, they wouldn’t have gotten anything in return. Looking now, the package of utility man Kim Tae-Jin, 1,000,000,000 Won, and future second-round pick catcher Kim Dong-Heon was a very solid return. However, Kiwoom could have used the bat of Park Dong-Won when they made it to the Korean series that year. What these deals have in common is trading away contract-year players when they are still competing for a playoff spot. Kiwoom ended up out of the playoffs by only 5 games in 2017 and was in 3rd place for 2022. In addition to what I believe are questionable trades by the Front Office, their decisions in free agency are questionable as well. Nexen signed their 3rd basemen to a deal in 2018 but traded him to LG for 500,000,000 Won. Another player who had been a cornerstone of the Nexen lineup, but he was gone. More recently in 2022, Kiwoom could have signed any of the big bats in free agency. Kiwoom signed reliever Won Jong-Hyun, resigned pitcher Jung Chan-Heon and signed outfielder Lee Hyung-Jong from the LG Twins. Now a couple of years ago that deal would have been huge, but Lee Hyung-Jong’s production has slowed down a little over the past couple of years. This season he has still been solid for Kiwoom, but when they had the possibility of spending more money and getting a big bat in Chae Eun-Seong or Noh Jin-Hyuk, both positions of need, it's a little disappointing. </p>
  <p>But everything I've said up to this point didn't matter to me. Although Kiwoom made me frustrated, we were making the playoffs and our team always had some sort of strength. Slowly over time, it shifted from our hitting to our pitching. This year Kiwoom had arguably the best top 3 pitchers in Baseball with An Woo-Jin, Ariel Jurado, and Choi Won-Tae. But none of that matters, because being a Kiwoom fan is the hardest thing in the world. In the span of about a week, my entire outlook on my team has changed to literally wanting to switch teams. Kiwoom's star outfielder and potential future major leaguer Lee Jung-Hoo required surgery due to an ankle injury and was ruled out for the next three months. This meant Kiwoom's already extremely weak offense was now losing its second-best offense player. For a team currently ranking last in OBP and Slugging Percentage, this loss is crushing. To rub salt in the wound, in a game vs Hanhwa, Kiwoom went into the top of the 8th inning with a 6-3 lead and went to the bottom of the 8th down 16-6. They gave up 13 runs in one inning with 11 of them coming when they had two outs, which broke the KBO record for most 2 out runs in one inning. Additionally in the two games they have played against last place Samsung, Jurado's 7.1 IP of 1 run ball did not matter as Kiwoom ended the game in a 5-5 draw, and in the second game lost 7-2. If the previous moves were salt in the wound, this news was like squeezing lemon juice in it and then stabbing it. Kiwoom announced the trade of their star pitcher Choi Won-Tae. Choi had been quietly improving over the past couple of seasons and was in what looked like a career-high year. But again like before Kiwoom traded one of their best players for a return. Choi Won-Tae was projected to be a free agent at the end of next season meaning Kiwoom still had a chance to try and negotiate an extension, but apparently, there were little talks of it. In return for Choi Won-Tae the Heroes actually did receive a pretty good return. In return, Kiwoom received star prospect Lee Joo-Hyung, pitcher Kim Dong-Gyu, and a 1st round pick in next year's draft. However, I am done. Choi Won-Tae has been one of my favorite players this season and in the past couple of seasons. He has always been quietly solid for the team and trading him is a sign of rebuilding for a team that still has effective players. I am tired of constantly losing in the playoffs and making questionable front-office choices. For most sports fans, this is normal, but Kiwoom is a relatively new team that has yet to win a championship with some of arguably the best rosters in the past couple of years. Most expansion teams in the KBO have recently won their first championships as well, and even if they return to mediocrity after winning it, they still have a championship. But now I am officially considering moving teams. Maybe I should go to LG, a team I said I hated for so long for beating my Heroes in the playoffs. They have Choi Won-Tae now and many other great players including Hong Chang-Ki and Kim Hyun-Soo. Or maybe I should just go back to Samsung, which is currently in a rebuild with many promising young players, such as Won Tae-In or Kim Hyeonn-Joon. Either way, I am tired of Kiwoom and its constant BS.</p>
