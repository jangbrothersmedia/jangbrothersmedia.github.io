  <h1>Player Spotlight: Starting Pitchers</h1>
  <p class="lead">Author: Andrew Jang</p>
  <p class="lead">Published on: August 27, 2023</p>
  <h2>OF Kim Sung-Yoon </h2>
  <img src="kimsy.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
  <h3>Bats: Left, Throws: Left </h3>
  <h3>163 cm, 62 kg (5-3, 135lbs)</h3>
  <h3> Team: Samsung Lions </h3> 
  <h3>  Age: 24 (2/2/1999) </h3>
  </h3> MLB player comparison: Michael Taylor </h3>

  <p>Kim has been with Samsung since 2017 but has really come into his own this season. His skill set of good contact and elite speed makes him a constant nuisance on offense and someone who can cover a lot of ground in the outfield. Although Kim has less than 200 at-bats, he has played in 80 games for the Lions this season due to his defense.</p>

  <p>After being a relatively unknown name to most fans, Kim broke out in the second half of the season. </p>
  <p>First Half Stats: 52 G, 69 AB, .217 BA, 15 H, 0 HR, 11 R, 9 RBI, 6 SB, 12 K, 6 BB, .577 OPS</p>
  <p>Second Half Stats: 28 G, 91 AB, .440 BA, 40 H, 2 HR, 20 R, 14 RBI, 8 SB, 9 K, 6 BB, 1.053 OPS</p>
  <p>In about half the games he had in the first half, Kim has gotten more at-bats and nearly doubled most of his production from the first half of the season. He’s making more and better contact with the ball, as his contact sits at around 82% and his BABIP is .364. </p>
  <p>Additionally, Kim’s hustle play has endeared him to many fans. His constant high-intensity play, such as diving to first base, shows how much effort he is putting in to try and help the team win. His uniform marking kit has already sold out for the Samsung away jerseys.</p>

  <p>Although Samsung is out of a playoff spot, and most likely won’t be able to make one, they seem to have found a similar replacement for their formal speedy centerfielder, Park Hae-Min. Let’s hope Kim can continue his productive breakout season and help Samsung contend in the future!</p>
