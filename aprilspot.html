  <h2>Young Player Spotlight!</h2>

    <h3>Player Spotlight: Cheon Seong-Ho 2B</h3>
    <img src="cheon.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
    <h6>This week’s position player spotlight goes to KT Wiz 2nd basemen Cheon Seung-Ho after a terrific opening week!</h6>
    <p>Statline: 17 GP, 79 PA, .378 BA, .418 OBP, .419 SLG, .837 OPS, 16, R, 6 RBI, 4 BB</p>
    <p>Although KT's overall play has been subpar this season, Cheon has been a spark for the team’s offense. After last playing in 2021 and then serving in the military, it seems Cheon has returned with an upgraded bat. Cheon could be the key to waking up this KT team which has been dormant so far.</p>
    

    <h3>Player Spotlight: Shin Min-Hyuk SP</h3>
    <img src="shin.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
    <h6>This week’s pitcher spotlight goes to NC Dinos Starting Pitcher Shin Min-Hyuk</h6>
    <p>Statline: 4 GS, 22 IP, 1.64 ERA, 1.05 WHIP, 13 K, 2 BB</p>
    <p>A member of the South Korean National team that played the Padres in an exhibition game earlier this year, Shin has shown what got him on that team so far. NC has surged to the top of the rankings this season and in a rotation that was expected to be weaker following the loss of pivotal arms Erick Fedde and Koo Chang-Mo, this year was expected to be a toss-up. Receiving opportunities since 2020, Shin has seen gradual improvements each season with 2023 being his first sub-4 ERA and sub-1.3 WHIP season, with what looks like an even bigger jump this season. If Shin continues his dominance, NC will have another ace on their hands.</p>
