  <h1>Rookie Of The Year Power Rankings</h1>
  <p class="lead">Author: Andrew Jang</p>
  <p class="lead">Published on: September 4, 2023</p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <h2>September Rookie of The Year Power Rankings</h2>

    <h4>5. Lee Ju-Hyoung OF</h4>
    <h6>Bats: Left, Throws: Right</h6>
    <h6>183 cm, 80 kg (6-0, 176lbs)</h6>
    <h6>Age: 22 (4/2/2001)</h6>
    <h6>Team: Kiwoom Heroes</h6>
    <img src="leeJH.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
    <p>2023 Stats: 48 G, 149 PA, 44 H, 4 HR, 21 R, 27 RBI, 3 SB, 8 BB, .328 BA, .374 OBP, .507 SLG, .881 OPS, 144 WRC+, 1.32 WAR.</p>
    <p>His small sample size will restrict him from placing higher, but Lee has been phenomenal since his trade to Kiwoom. Since replacing the injured Lee Jung-Hoo in centerfield, Lee has been a sparkplug in the dead Heroes offense. He and Kim Dong-Heon make up a Heroes rookie tandem which has been one of the only positives of the season for Kiwoom so far. If he continues this level of play he could have a chance.</p>
    

    <h4>4. Choi Ji-Min RP</h4>
    <h6>Bats: Left, Throws: Left</h6>
    <h6>185 cm, 100 kg (6-1, 220lbs)</h6>
    <h6>Age: 19 (9/10/2003)</h6>
    <h6>Team: KIA Tigers</h6>
    <img src="choiJM.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
    <p>2023 Stats: 50 G, 52.1 IP, 2.06 ERA, 1.18 WHIP, 40 SO, 11 H, 3 SV, 1.25 WAR.</p>
    <p>Relievers in Korea are held in much higher esteem than they would be in the MLB. Thus, having a reliable 19-year-old lefty reliever is immensely valuable. KIA’s pitching has been one of its underrated strengths, and Choi is a major piece of their bullpen. For his efforts, Choi was also voted as an All-Star this season. If KIA maintains its spot in the playoffs, Choi’s impressive résumé could get even better.</p>
    


    <h4>3. Kim Min-Suk</h4>
    <h6>Bats: Left, Throws: Right</h6>
    <h6>185 cm, 83 kg (6-1, 183lbs)</h6>
    <h6>Age: 19 (5/9/2004)</h6>
    <h6>Team: Lotte Giants</h6>
    <img src="kimMS.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
    <p>2023 Stats: 102 G, 364 PA, 86 H, 3 HR, 48 R, 35 RBI, 14 SB, 27 BB, .269 BA, .327 OBP, .356 SLG, .683 OPS, 84 WRC+, 1.20 WAR.</p>
    <p>Kim comes from the same high school as KBO superstars Lee Jung-Hoo and An Woo-Jin and has shown his potential this season with the Giants. While his offensive numbers may not pop out to an average fan, his all-around play has made him a fan favorite of many fans. In his first-ever season as a professional, he has missed only 7 games and ranks top 5th in WAR, SB, R, H, and 2B amongst all Lotte Giants. His impact on the team at a young age makes him a notable candidate for Rookie Of The Year.</p>
    

    <h4>2. Yoon Yung-Cheol</h4>
    <h6>Bats: Left, Throws: Left</h6>
    <h6>187 cm, 87 kg (6-2, 191lbs)</h6>
    <h6>Age: 19 (4/20/2004)</h6>
    <h6>Team: KIA Tigers</h6>
    <img src="yoonYC.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
    <p>2023 Stats: 20 G, 98 IP, 4.13 ERA, 1.39 WHIP, 59 SO, 6 QS, 1.26 WAR.</p>
    <p>KIA seems to be really good at getting good 19-year-old left-handed pitchers. Yoon, like Choi, has been a reliable pitcher for KIA during their playoff push. At only 19 years old he has started 19 games for the Tigers and pitched to an 8-5 record. Like Kim, he has proven that he can contribute to his team in his first professional season.</p>
    


    <h4>1. Moon Dong-Ju</h4>
    <h6>Bats: Right, Throws: Right</h6>
    <h6>188 cm, 97 kg (6-2, 213lbs)</h6>
    <h6>Age: 19 (12/23/2003)</h6>
    <h6>Team: Hanwha Eagles</h6>
    <img src="moonD.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
    <p>2023 Stats: 22 G, 114.1 IP, 3.62 ERA, 1.24 WHIP, 93 SO, 7 QS, 2.30 WAR.</p>
    <p>Known for his high-velocity fastball and strikeout numbers, Moon has broken out in his second professional season. Although Hanwha is out of the playoff race, he is the leader of the young core which they hope to contend with in the future. He seems to be the frontrunner in the Rookie of the Year race.</p>
