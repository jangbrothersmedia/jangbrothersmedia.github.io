  <h1>KBO Top 10s: Starting Pitchers</h1>
  <p class="lead">Author: Andrew Jang</p>
  <p class="lead">Published on: July 21, 2023</p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>As the KBO season progresses, the competition among starting pitchers is fiercer than ever. In this article, we will take a look at the top ten starting pitchers who have been dominating the league with their impressive performances on the mound. From strikeouts to ERA, these players have been putting on a show for KBO fans around the world. Now that we have reached the halfway point of the season, its time to evaluate how good each player is doing. These are my top ten picks for the starting pitcher position.</p>

  <h2>Top Ten KBO Starting Pitchers</h2>

    <h4>10. Gwak Been 곽빈</h4>
    <img src="gwak.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
    <p>2023 Stats: 12 GS, 65 IP, 50 K, 2.08 ERA, 1.11 WHIP, 3.61 FIP, 3.00 WPA, 1.81 WAR</p>
    <p>Synopsis: Although an early injury kept him out for most of May, Gwak Been has been crucial to Doosan's recent success. He has racked up an impressive 1.81 WAR and is 8-2 in his 12 Games Started. In addition, he ranks 6th in WPA among all pitchers. Gwak Been's K% and BB% have remained similar to last season, but his HR/9 have decreased dramatically to the rate of 0.14, resulting in his current stellar season.</p>
    

    <h4>9. Choi Won-Tae 최원태</h4>
    <img src="wontae.png".png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
    <p>2023 Stats: 16 GS, 97.1 IP, 77 K, 3.05 ERA, 1.14 WHIP, 3.70 FIP, 2.78 WPA, 2.32 WAR</p>
    <p>Synopsis: The 26-year-old righty has looked great in his eighth season as a pro. Although Kiwoom has been struggling lately, Choi Won-Tae's constant improvement has always kept the Heroes in the playoff race. Due to his increased breaking ball usage, his K% has increased by 5% in addition to a 2% decrease in BB%. </p>


    <h4>8. Felix Pena 페냐</h4>
    <img src="pena.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
    <p>2023 Stats: 17 GS, 98.2 IP, 82 K, 2.83 ERA, 1.13 WHIP, 3.97 FIP, 1.98 WPA, 2.12 WAR</p>
    <p>Synopsis: Pena has been exactly what a young Hanhwa team needs: a reliable ace. In 17 GS, Pena has 11 QS, and since the start of May Hanhwa is 8-4 in the games that he has pitched. For a team that has finished last in the past three seasons, Pena has been helping them stay in the hunt for the playoffs.</p>
    

    <h4>7. Ariel Jurado 후라도</h4>
    <img src="ariel.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
    <p>2023 Stats: 18 GS, 111.2 IP, 91 K, 2.90 ERA, 1.18 WHIP, 3.23 FIP, 2.36 WPA, 2.56 WAR</p>
    <p>Synopsis: Jurado has been a great pickup for the Heroes as he ranks top ten in WAR, ERA, Strikeouts, WHIP, QS, and 1st in IP. Despite his 5-8 record, Kiwoom will continue to rely on their workhorse to relieve their bullpen as Jurado has pitched at least six innings in 14 out of his 18 games. </p>
    

    <h4>6. David Buchanan 뷰캐넌</h4>
    <img src="david.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
    <p>2023 Stats: 17 GS, 109.1 IP, 96 K, 2.88 ERA, 1.14 WHIP, 2.67 FIP, 2.47 WPA, 2.90 WAR</p>
    <p>Synopsis: In his 4th season for the Lions, Buchanan is having his best season to date. Buchanan is enjoying a K rate of 21% with a career-best 5% walk rate. Additionally, In 109.1 innings, Buchanan has given up only 3 home runs. Although the Lions are in last place, Buchanan remains a bright spot on the team.</p>
    

    <h4>5. Go Young-Pyo 고영표</h4>
    <img src="go.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
    <p>2023 Stats: 16 GS, 103.2 IP, 73 K, 2.78 ERA, 1.05 WHIP, 2.98 FIP, 2.82 WPA, 3.25 WAR</p>
    <p>Synopsis: Go has enjoyed a nice season in which he was voted an All-Star. He is inducing groundballs at a rate of 71.5% and has lowered his walk rate to a career-best 2.2%. Furthermore, he leads the league in K/BB and BB/9. Go is a player to keep your eye on in the second half as the KT Wiz try to secure a playoff spot.</p>
    

    <h4>4. Adam Plutko 플럿코</h4>
    <img src="plut.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
    <p>2023 Stats: 17 GS, 102 IP, 82 K, 2.21 ERA, 1.10 WHIP, 2.97 FIP, 3.03 WPA, 3.35 WAR</p>
    <p>Synopsis: Plutko is continuing his dominance from last season. The Twins are an absurd 14-1-2 when Plutko starts for them. Plutko has continued to walk batters at a low rate, in addition to lowering his HR/9 and Hard%. If LG wants to stay in first, they will need Plutko to keep performing well.</p>
    

    <h4>3. Erick Fedde 페디</h4>
    <img src="fedde.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
    <p>2023 Stats: 15 GS, 89.2 IP, 109 K, 1.71 ERA, 1.01 WHIP, 2.64 FIP, 3.22 WPA, 3.58 WAR</p>
    <p>Synopsis: In his first year in the KBO, Fedde has been dominating the competition. Fedde's success has complemented the breakout of NC's batters which sees them currently in 4th place. Although he has pitched less than most of the other pitchers on the list, Fedde ranks 1st in ERA and wins, and second in WHIP and strikeouts among all pitchers. His absurd 30.4% K rate and 6.4% walk rate make him one of the hardest pitchers to face in the KBO. Fedde and the Dinos will have to continue their current success to maintain their current playoff spot.</p>
    

    <h4>2. Raul Alcantara 알칸타라</h4>
    <img src="alc.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
    <p>2023 Stats: 17 GS, 106.2 IP, 107 K, 2.03 ERA, 0.94 WHIP, 2.71 FIP, 3.52 WPA, 3.61 WAR</p>
    <p>Synopsis: After two years, Alcantara has picked up right where he left off with Doosan. Alcantara has struck out batters at a rate of 25.4% while only walking batters at a rate of 4.1%. In addition to his great strikeout numbers, Alcantara ranks first in WHIP with 0.94. Alcantara along with recently acquired pitcher Brandon Waddell make up a lethal one-two punch for the Doosan Bears which will hopefully see them through to the playoffs.</p>
    

    <h4>1. An Woo-Jin</h4>
    <img src="ahn.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
    <p>2023 Stats: 17 GS, 107 IP, 130 K, 2.44 ERA, 1.05 WHIP, 2.00 FIP, 3.57 WPA, 4.09 WAR</p>
    <p>Synopsis: The winner of last year's Gold Glove, An Woo-Jin has continued his breakout success from last season. An is known for his high-velocity Fastball as well as his devastating slider. An's dominance is shown in his strikeout numbers as he ranks first, beating out second place by 21 strikeouts. An also ranks first in WPA and WAR. An has lowered his walk rate from last season to a rate of 5.5%, as well as increasing his already high K rate to 30%. The Heroes will need every win they can get out of An as they try to battle back from 9th place.</p>
