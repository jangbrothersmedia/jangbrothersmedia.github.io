  <p class="lead">Author: Andrew Jang</p>
  <p class="lead">Published on: July 21, 2023</p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>As the KBO season progresses, the competition among starting pitchers is fiercer than ever. In this article, we will take a look at the top ten starting pitchers who have been dominating the league with their impressive performances on the mound. From strikeouts to ERA, these players have been putting on a show for KBO fans around the world. Now that we have reached the halfway point of the season, its time to evaluate how good each player is doing. These are my top ten picks for the starting pitcher position.</p>

  <h2>Top Ten KBO Starting Pitchers</h2>

    <h4>10. Gwak Been 곽빈</h4>
    <img src="gwak.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
    <p>2023 Stats: 12 GS, 65 IP, 50 K, 2.08 ERA, 1.11 WHIP, 3.61 FIP, 3.00 WPA, 1.81 WAR</p>
    <p>Synopsis: Although an early injury kept him out for most of May, Gwak Been has been crucial to Doosan's recent success. He has racked up an impressive 1.81 WAR and is 8-2 in his 12 Games Started. In addition, he ranks 6th in WPA among all pitchers. Gwak Been's K% and BB% have remained similar to last season, but his HR/9 have decreased dramatically to the rate of 0.14, resulting in his current stellar season.</p>
    

    <h4>9. Choi Won-Tae 최원태</h4>
    <img src="wontae.png".png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
    <p>2023 Stats: 16 GS, 97.1 IP, 77 K, 3.05 ERA, 1.14 WHIP, 3.70 FIP, 2.78 WPA, 2.32 WAR</p>
    <p>Synopsis: The 26-year-old righty has looked great in his eighth season as a pro. Although Kiwoom has been struggling lately, Choi Won-Tae's constant improvement has always kept the Heroes in the playoff race. Due to his increased breaking ball usage, his K% has increased by 5% in addition to a 2% decrease in BB%. </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>These ten starting pitchers have proven themselves as the best of the best in the KBO. Whether it's their impressive strikeout rates, low ERAs, or the ability to consistently keep their teams in the game, these players are the backbone of their respective teams' pitching staffs. As the season progresses, it will be exciting to see how these talented pitchers continue to perform and compete for the top spot in the league.</p>
