  <h1>Offseason Recap: February 1st</h1>
  <p class="lead">Author: Andrew Jang</p>
  <p class="lead">Published on: February 1st, 2024</p>

  <h3>Welcome back to Korean Baseball! There's a lot to update you on so let's get to it!</h3>
  <h4>MLB-KBO?</h4>
  <p>The KBO has seen a myriad of players go to the MLB resulting in success (Ryu Hyun-Jin, Kang Jung-Ho, Kim Ha-Seong). However many have questioned whether players can transition from the KBO to the MLB. This offseason could be the solution to flipping this stigma on its head.</p>

  <h4>Lee Jung-Hoo</h4>
  <img src="giantsjhleee.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
  <p>Kiwoom fans were sad to let their long-tenured superstar go to the San Francisco Giants for a record 6-year, $113 million contract. Lee joins the long list of former Heroes attempting an overseas transition (Park Byung-Ho, Kang Jung-Ho, Kim Ha-Seong), but if the success of players such as Ha Seong-Kim has taught us anything, it is that succeeding in the MLB is possible. Obviously, expectations of Lee will be high, but if the skills he’s shown us for the past seven years carry over, he’s sure to be worth every penny.</p>


  <h4>Go Woo-Suk</h4>
  <img src="padresgo.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
  <p>Former LG Twins closer Go Woo-Suk signed a 2-year, $4.5 million contract to join the San Diego Padres and his former rival, Kim Ha-Seong. Go, known for his high velocity, surprisingly asked to be posted to MLB teams after a subpar year, at least for his standards. Usually an elite closer, Go regressed slightly last year, but still managed to help the LG Twins win a championship. Let’s hope he can continue to carry over that winning tradition to the Padres!</p>


  <h4>Ryu Hyun-Jin</h4>
  <img src="ryureturn.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
  <p>In a surprise twist, former Dodgers and Bluejays pitcher and KBO legend Ryu Hyun-Jin made the trip back to Korea to sign for his former team, the Hanhwa Eagles. Ryu, a master in control and run prevention, joins a young budding Hanwha team with rising superstars Roh Shi-Hwan and Moon Dong-Ju, the Prince of Daejeon, who could be gunning for the playoffs. Ryu battled an unlucky streak of injuries the past 2 seasons but returned to Korea looking to retain the form we saw him in with the Dodgers and the Eagles.</p>
  
  
   <h3>KBO Free Agency</h3>
   <p>While the KBO free agency isn’t always filled with superstars, the small nature of the league makes any move an impactful one. Let’s see how this year’s free agency could shake up the rankings!</p>

   <h4>Samsung Gets Bullpen Help</h4>
   <img src="kimFA.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
   <img src="limFA.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
   <p>Samsung secured the likes of relief pitchers Kim Jae-Yoon and Lim Chang Min. Kim Jae-Yoon, KT’s former closer, has accrued over 150 saves over his closer and posted a 2.60 ERA with a 1.02 WHIP last season. In addition, Lim Chang Min accrued 26 saves last season while posting a 2.51 ERA for the Kiwoom Heroes. Alongside the likes of Korean Baseball legend Oh Seung-Hwan, Samsung’s bullpen looks lethal.</p>

   <h4>Hanhwa Bolsters their Infield</h4>
   <img src="ahnFA.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
   <p>Former Lotte Giant and KIA Tiger Ahn Chi-Hong agreed to a deal with the Hanwha Eagles for 4 years with an option for up to 2 more years. Ahn hopes to help a young Hanwha infield with players such as Roh Shi-Hwan and Jung Eun-Won. With a new veteran presence, Hanwha’s era of mediocrity seems to be coming to an end.</p>
   
   <h4>KBO's “Rule 5 Draft” sees two veterans switch teams</h4>
   <img src="joo5.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
   <img src="kimEagles.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
   <p>Two SSG Lander’s players saw their teams switch. Choi Joo-Hwan was drafted by the Kiwoom Heroes and long-tenured Lander/Wyvern Kim Kang-Min was taken by Hanwha. Kim who spent 21 years with the Incheon-based team, sees a move south where he could get more playing time, while the slugging infielder Choi looks to improve on his season from last year. While both veterans have moved to previously struggling teams, don’t count them out from helping their squads make the playoffs.</p>


   <h4>Seoul Series</h4>
   <img src="series.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Player 1 Image"> 
   <p>I like to imagine my younger self going to a KBO game at Gocheok Sky Dome for the first time and telling him that in a couple of years, the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres featuring a Korean player would play the MLB season opener there. Seeing Korean representation in the MLB was something I could have never imagined, but with the renaissance of Kim Ha-Seong and Korean players making the next step to the major league level, people are taking note of baseball in Korea. Not only were we treated to an electric matchup between two NL West Giants, but we also got to see MLB teams square off against the KBO Champion LG Twins and the National team. I’m so glad that MLB decided to have their home opener in Seoul and I hope they continue to grow the game and show exposure to baseball in a multitude of other countries!</p>
