  <h4>Doosan and Kiwoom take heavy losses</h4>
  <p>Kiwoom struggled this week as they lost 1-5-1 losing two games to Hanhwa and Samsung. With news of outfielder Lee Jung-Hoo being ruled out for the remainder of the season, Kiwoom committed to a rebuild and traded pitcher Choi Won-Tae to the LG Twins, but more on that in my rant piece. The inability of Kiwoom’s offense to provide run support for their pitching staff has resorted in their poor result and it looks like they are deciding to commit to next year. In contrast, Doosan’s 11-game win streak was immediately followed by a 5-game loss streak with a crucial series sweep by the LG Twins. Doosan still sits in 3rd place, but they are now closer to being overtaken by the NC Dinos. Doosan must maintain their stellar play to keep their secure playoff spot.</p>
  <p>Notable Performers: 
    Kiwoom: 
    OF Ronnie Dawson: 9 for 21, 1 2B, 5R, 5 RBI, 4 BB.
    3B Song Sung-Moon: 7 for 25, 1 2B, 3 R, 8 RBI, 1 BB.
    SP An Woo-Jin: 8 IP, 2 H, 10K, 1 BB, 0 ER, W.
    
    Doosan: 
    OF Jung Soo-Bin: 4 for 15, 1 3B, 2 R, 1 RBI, 3 BB. 
    OF Kim Jae-Hwan: 4 for 14, 1 HR, 2 R, 4 RBI, 2 BB. 
    RP Choi Seung-Yong: 5.2 IP, 5 H, 2K, 1 BB, 3 ER.

  <h4>KIA, KT, and LG break out the brooms</h4>
  <p>The KIA Tigers, KT Wiz, and LG Twins all ended the week with sweeps over the Lotte Giants, NC Dinos, and Doosan Bears respectively. KIA was finally able to show off what made them so dangerous coming into this season: their potent offense. Although they were dealing with injuries, during the All-Star break it seems KIA was able to come back with a fully healthy lineup. With a matchup with the Lotte Giants, one of the worst pitching teams in the league, it was time for KIA’s offense to cruise them to victory. In addition to a great lineup, KIA’s underrated pitching has helped them stay in the playoff race so far. The KT Wiz have seemingly come out of nowhere to claim a postseason spot after being a bottom 5 team. KT’s extremely strong pitching has helped fuel their current success. They took two games against the LG Twins and In each game against the NC Dinos, KT held one of the best offenses in the KBO to two runs each game. In addition to their great pitching, KT’s offense has been sneaky good. Although they are lacking power, their offense ranks 3rd in OBP and 4th in OPS. They are now in 5th with a 1.5-game advantage over KIA. LG’s success is pretty obvious as they are in 1st place, but this week they went out and swept one of the hottest teams in the KBO. Reeling off two losses following an 11-game win streak, LG would have to face off against Raúl Alcántara, Kim Dong-Joo, and Brandon Waddell. However instead of floundering, LG dominated Doosan’s usually great pitchers. LG’s offense has been their strong point this season with their pitching being a little shaky. To improve their rotation, LG went out and traded for Choi Won-Tae. Choi debuted for them this week and helped shut out the Doosan Bears en route to a 10-0 victory. With the addition of a dominant starting pitcher, it seems LG doesn’t have any weaknesses. What is most notable about all of these series’ was that in addition to being swept, these were all playoff teams. KIA and KT are now fighting for a wildcard spot and LG repelled a challenger to their 1st place throne. These teams will be feeling the momentum coming into this next week. </p>
